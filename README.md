# Mask-Detector
This is a simple app that detects mask wearing from an image or a live video stream. The model is based on google's MobileNetV2 architecture that uses depthwise separable convolution as building blocks. 
It is a livid demonstration of how machine learning can be used for surveillance and ultimately disease control.

### Parts
1. mask_image.py - Detects mask wearing from an image
2. mask_video_stream.py - Detects mask wearing from a video stream
3. train_mask_detector.py - Trains the model on the sample dataset
